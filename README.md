### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently working in web development and have more than 5 years of professional experience. I have worked across the full technology stack, but I am especially passionate about backend development and database technologies. I have worked on many Web services, user interfaces, and data processing scripts. My main strengths are with Java and MongoDB, and I have certifications in both.

I am currently exploring my interest in data science and machine learning. I have been been making use of different Python libraries, such as NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow.
 
If you are interested in networking or collaborating please reach out to me at my email <jeffreycarter.cpe@gmail.com> ðŸ“«
